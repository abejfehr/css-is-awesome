# So you think you know CSS

- Fix weird indentation on the CSS in some levels
- Add better meta description and title
- Make it obvious how to play the game
  - Maybe a ghost box that resizes on the first level?
- Add label to the container box
  - not sure how I want to lay that out yet
- Add educational links
  - w3c
  - blog posts
- Add links to codepens/jsfiddles of complete examples
- Make better theme for syntax highlighting and everything
- Prevent position from getting out of sync
- Show some context at the end of a level
  - Examples of what could've been built with it maybe?
- Hint button
- Add mobile support (or tell people to use desktop)
- Link to myself somewhere
- Let people share their progress
- remove margin from around confetti

Things to test people on:

- box model
  - box width/height
  - margin
  - padding
  - negative margin
- positioning
  - position: absolute;
  - position: sticky;
- flex
  - flex-wrap;
- grid
  - display: grid;
- lobotomized owl
