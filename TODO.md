WIP
- Rename the game something else
- Add educational links
  - w3c
  - blog posts

TODO
- Add option to play again after complete
- Maybe put the box coordinates/name on the right side in a "properties" area?
- Add label to the container box
  - not sure how I want to lay that out yet
- Add links to codepens/jsfiddles of complete examples
- Prevent position from getting out of sync
- Show some context at the end of a level
  - Examples of what could've been built with it maybe?
- Hint button
- Add mobile support (or tell people to use desktop)
- Link to myself somewhere
- Let people share their progress

TODIDN'T
- Make boxes be bounded by other boxes
  - Putting this on hold right now since it's a weird experience if you move the parent outside the child
- Add handles to the boxes to indicate affordances for dragging/resizing
  - Putting this on hold for now

Things to test people on:

- box model
  - box width/height
  - margin
  - padding
  - negative margin
- positioning
  - position: absolute;
  - position: sticky;
- flex
  - flex-wrap;
- grid
  - display: grid;
- lobotomized owl
